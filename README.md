# roundcube-dbmail
Repository for the DBMAIL Storage plugin for Roundcube

---
## Introduction

rcube_dmail is a _storage plugin_ for roundcube webmail (http://roundcube.net), intended to directly hook roundcube into dbmail (http://dbmail.org/) database.

the plugin is a pretty rough proof of concept right now, and is not intended (yet) for real usage. it's currently functionalities are:
* Login
* Folder listing
* Messages listing
* Message retrival

Missing functionalities, currently under development, are:
* Searching functions
* Message writing

The plugin is currently only tested with **MySQL**, but plans include support for postgre and other.

any help is greatly welcome :-)
